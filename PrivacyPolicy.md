This privacy policy applies to the Nano Writing Journal mobile application.
1. Our commitment to your privacy
Your privacy is a top priority. We believe that your creative writing is personal and should remain private. This policy is our commitment to that principle.
2. Data collection and storage
The App does not collect, store, or transmit any personal data from your device to us or any third parties. Everything you create is stored exclusively on your device.
No data is sent to our servers.
No data is sent to third-party services.
No personal information is collected.
3. Data processing
Because no user data is ever transmitted from your device, no data is processed on our end. All processing of your writing and project information happens locally on your device to provide the functionality of the App.
4. Your data and third-party services
The App does not use any third-party analytics, advertisements, or other services that could collect, track, or analyze your data. Your writing is your own and is not shared with anyone.
5. Your control over your data
You are in full control of your data at all times. Since all data is stored on your device, deleting the App will permanently delete all of the content and projects you have created. You can also back up your data locally using your device's built-in backup tools (such as iCloud Backup or Google Drive backup).
6. Changes to this privacy policy
We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.
